NEWS file for R project ANOINT

Version 1.1

The package formerly named mim has been renamed ANOINT for analysis of interactions. 

Version 1.1 has packaged the methods from the previous versions into a class anoint and anoint.fit. The anoint class holds the information about the model fit formula, candidate treatment-response factor (interaction terms), and the results of the selection procedure, if requested. The anoint.fit class performs all of the ANOINT methods (one-by-one, unrestricted interaction model, and proportional interaction) and provides methods to inspect and summary their results.
